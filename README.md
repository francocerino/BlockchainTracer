# BlockchainTracer
Python package to trace sensible information and processes in blockchain.

Blockchain is inmutable, transparent, full availability, traceable.

Save sequential steps of anything.

## Implentation

A single Python class multipurpose.

## Multipurpose

 - Upload hashes of big data files. 
 - Improve reproducibility of Machine Learning models. There is a 'reproducibility crysis'.
 - Trace NGO donations.
 - Improve supply chain traceability.
 - Save important data of scientific studies.
 - Any text.
 - What you want.

## Roadmap

 - Fine-tune the case of ML. Requirements for good reproducibility.
 - Ensure the code works well. Easy for the user.
 - Python code to facilitate technical people, not necessarily in blockchain.
 - Integration with an EVM blockchain.
 - Integration with IPFS for large data.
 - Extend to other blockchains.
 - Extend to private blockchains.
 - Frontend for scalability.
 - Code in smart contract to enhance decentralization of the code used.
 - Option to create and write with a new address.
