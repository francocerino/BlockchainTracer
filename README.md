# BlockchainTracer
Python package to trace sensible information and processes in blockchain.

Blockchain is inmutable, transparent, full availability, traceable.

Save sequential steps of anything.

## Implentation

A single Python class multipurpose.

## Multipurpose

 - Improve reproducibility of Machine Learning models. There is a 'reproducibility crysis'. (THIS IS THE MAIN IDEA)
 - Upload hashes of big data files. 
 - Trace NGO donations.
 - Improve supply chain traceability.
 - Save important data of scientific studies.
 - Any text.
 - What you want.

## Roadmap

### Stage 1

 1. Read saved and related bibliography to clarify the needed things for ML reproducibility.

    - [ref 1](https://sci-hub.se/10.1145/1084805.1084812)
    - [ref 2](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10464202)
    - [ref 3](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/bresci/article/view/10033/9915)
    - [ref 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10110)
    - [ref 5](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622237)


 2. Fine-tune the case of ML. Requirements for good reproducibility.
 3. Give the user things needed for reproducibility the model.
 4. Ensure the code is easy to use and works well. 
    - Python code to facilitate technical people, not necessarily in blockchain.
    - Integration with EVM blockchains (the most used).

### Stage 2

 5. Solve what to do with code and binaries.
 6. Integration with IPFS for large data.
 
 ### Stage 3

 7. Frontend for scalability (usable by non-technical persons).
 8. Smart contract to decentralice the code used.
 9. Extend to other public blockchains.
 10. Extend to private blockchains. 
 11. Display option to trace data with a new address.
